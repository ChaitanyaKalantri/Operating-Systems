# Operating-Systems

## Assignment 1: Deduplication 

#### Task:
The task was to create a ***new system call*** that can take two input files, then deduplicate them if they have identical content.

#### Learnings:
- The assignment focused on getting used to the ***Linux kernel development*** environment working.
- It also made us understand about the working and usage of ***System Calls***.

## Assignment 2: Secure Garbage File System

#### Task:
The task is to modify wrapfs to add "Secure Garbage File System" (sgfs) support.

#### Learnings:
- The assignment helped to get familiar with the ***VFS layer*** of Linux.
- ***Encryption*** and ***Decryption*** of a file

## Assignment 3: Asychronous Process-based Queues

#### Task:
To develop a Linux kernel-based system to support process-based queues for handling file protection (encryption), compression, etc. 
[https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ezk/cse506-s18/hw3.txt]

#### Learnings:
- It helped to understand how to implement the ***asynchronous process-based queues***.
- It helped to perform a lot of complex operations together. Such as a file before moving to the recycle bin was performed with ***Encryption***, ***Compression***, ***Renaming*** all one after other asynchronously.
- It helped to develop an ***efficient system*** so that a lot of operations could be performed in the least amount of time possible.
